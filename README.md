# SaliensBossCheck
Checks and notifies whenever a boss is available in Steam's Saliens game.

For all those not wanting to cheat in the game but still wanting to level up manually, you can use this little tool to check whenever a boss appears in the game so you can jump in and play against a boss instead of regular enemies, since a boss gives the most XP. 

You only need to install the script in Tampermonkey and go to [this link](https://community.steam-api.com/ITerritoryControlMinigameService/GetPlanets/v0001/?active_only=1&language=english). The script checks once a minute if a boss appeared in the game. Whenever a boss appears the screen goes green, otherwise it stays red. Just leave the window open and do your stuff. Now you can play against bosses whenever they appear without using bots and cheats.
Have fun!
